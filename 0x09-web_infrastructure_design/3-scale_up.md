## Roles
1. A cluster of load balancers offers increased availability, improved performance, increased scalability, improved security and additional features such as session affinity, load balancing algorithms and health monitoring.

2. Splitting a web server, application server, and database server into separate servers offers improved performance and increased scalability. For example, the web server can be optimized for serving static files, while the application server can be optimized for processing dynamic requests or if the web server is overloaded it is easier to scale the web server independently to add more web servers to the cluster.
